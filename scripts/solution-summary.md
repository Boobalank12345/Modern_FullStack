# Birthday Reminder Tracker - Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Analysis
The 500 Internal Server Errors were occurring because:
1. Users were accessing protected API endpoints without authentication
2. The MongoDB connection was using the wrong connection method
3. No admin user existed in the database

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed MongoDB Connection
- **Issue**: API files were importing `dbConnect` but mongodb.js exported a client promise
- **Solution**: Updated `lib/mongodb.js` to export a proper `dbConnect` function using Mongoose
- **Result**: Database connection now works correctly with Mongoose models

### 2. ✅ Created Admin User
- **Issue**: No admin user existed in the database
- **Solution**: Created admin user with proper password hashing
- **Credentials**: 
  - Email: `admin@admin.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
  - Role: `admin`

### 3. ✅ Verified Authentication Flow
- **Issue**: API endpoints require authentication but users weren't logged in
- **Solution**: Confirmed login system works correctly
- **Result**: All API endpoints work when properly authenticated
